# NVIDIA GPU Shader Cache Cleaner
 .cmd script to easily wipe NVIDIA GPU shader cache
.cmd script to easily wipe GPU shader cache, requires IObit Unlocker installed (https://www.iobit.com/en/iobit-unlocker.php)

It's free and has full functionality for all NVIDIA GPUs.

All installation and deletion paths can be easily customized in a notepad.

This tool was created, because I clean my Shader Cache after driver updates. This can often help with FPS drops in games.
Just be aware that if you do that, then some games have to compile shaders after first launch. This process can be seen as high CPU usage when you start the game. This happens with Overwatch for me. So I just let the game compile all it needs. After short time CPU usage drops to normal. You can enjoy the smoother experience.

To download .cmd file, right click on Clear Shader Cache.cmd then choose "Save link as".

Run as admin.
