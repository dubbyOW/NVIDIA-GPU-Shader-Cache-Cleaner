.cmd script to easily wipe GPU shader cache, requires IObit Unlocker installed (https://www.iobit.com/en/iobit-unlocker.php)

It's free and has full functionality for all NVIDIA GPUs.

All installation and deletion paths can be easily customized in a notepad.

This tool was created, to wipe all Shader Cache folders after GPU driver updates. This can often help with FPS drops in games.
Just be aware that if you do that, then some games might have to compile shaders again after the first launch. This process can be seen as a high CPU usage when you start the game. This happens with Overwatch for example. So just let the game compile all it needs. After a short time CPU usage drops to normal. You can now enjoy a smoother gaming experience.

HOW TO USE:
1. Download and install IObit Unlocker.
2. Download .cmd script then right click on the script file and choose "Run as administrator".
